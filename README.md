# Keam Helm Charts

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add keam https://keamchart.com
```

If you had already added this repo earlier,
run `helm repo update` to retrieve the latest versions of the packages.

You can then run `helm search repo keam` to see the charts.

You can validate the chart versions by checking this [site](https://keamchart.com/index.yaml).

Woot woot!
